But, most importantly, because it's fun!

## Contests
* Every year, UniTN sponsors the participation of one team of students in the regional contest of the ACM-ICPC competition.  The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest  is the oldest programming competition, running since the seventies. In order to participate, teams are selected in the following way:

  * Universities organise local competitions to select the beast teams to send to the regional contest.

    At UniTN we run a series of meetings to train on the ACM-ICPC problems from April to May. At the end of May, a local competition is held to select one (or more) teams.

  * The best teams participate in a regional contest; Italy belongs to the SWERC group, whose competitions are normally held in November. 
  The expenses to participate in the event are (almost) fully covered by UniTN.

    The selected teams perform additional training from September to November.

  * The best teams in the regional contest participate in the world contest, usually held on the next year. 
  
* There are lots of online contests, the most important are the Google Code Jam organized by Google and the Facebook Hacker Cup organized by Facebook. Usually there are 2 or 3 online rounds and one final onsite round somewhere in the World. 

* You can also find some contests on Hackerrank (the Week of Code is a really good starting point), Codeforces and TopCoder. They are usually held once every week. The level of the problems goes from really easy to exceptionally hard. They also give you some kinds of editorial at the end of every contest, so you can learn a lot by reading them.
