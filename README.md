## Contests
Every year, UniTN sponsors the participation of one team of students in the regional contest of the ACM-ICPC competition.  The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest  is the oldest programming competition, running since the seventies. In order to participate, teams are selected in the following way:

Universities organise local competitions to select the beast teams to send to the regional contest.

At UniTN we run a series of meetings to train on the ACM-ICPC problems from April to May. At the end of May, a local competition is held to select one (or more) teams.

The best teams participate in a regional contest; Italy belongs to the SWERC group, whose competitions are normally held in November. 

The expenses to participate in the event are (almost) fully covered by UniTN.

The selected teams perform additional training from September to November.

The best teams in the regional contest participate in the world contest, usually held on the next year.
